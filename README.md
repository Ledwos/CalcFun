# CalcFun! ðŸ–©

Just as the name suggests, this is a calculator and coding is fun!

### Why did I make this?

Well I took some time off away from code (burnout) so I'm starting with something simple to get back into it.

## Tech Stack:

- HTML5 / CSS3
- JavaScript
- ReactJS

Maybe a backend of sorts once I had my fun playing with React ðŸ˜ƒ 
</br>
(whether I write it in JS / Python / Go is still undecided because Yagni right now)
</br>
</br>
Maybe I'll use Sass to be extra fancy and include a css preprocessor
</br>
</br>
I will also use this project to write some tests because that is also important for development.
